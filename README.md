# hello-world-again
Trying 2nd time. Hope I get it right.

Learning to use github. This is my first time and i'm starting with the time-honored project in programming; The Hello World program. My name is Veeresh Kamble. After wandering in the IT world with TCS, i have now come to do my master's in software engineering, learn a lot of new and exciting technologies and have a fresh, new start where I don't make the same mistakes I did the last time around.
